# My implementation of the Goomer backend challenge from [Their Github](https://github.com/goomerdev/job-dev-backend-interview)

## Stack

- Node.js
- TypeScript
- express.js
- MySQL

## Motivation

As a frontend developer, I haven't really worked on server side code and want to change that.
Since I already work with JavaScript / TypeScript on a daily basis, using a
Node.js solution to get my feet wet seems like a good choice

I'm trying to implemement this repo using Clean Architecture
